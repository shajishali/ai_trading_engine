# Step-by-Step: Why Signals Are Not Updating on Production

**Problem:** Same 19 signals on the signals page since yesterday — nothing new.

**Goal:** Run one command at a time, share the output, then we fix the root cause.

---

## Step 1 — Check if Celery Worker and Celery Beat are running

Signals are generated by a **scheduled Celery task** every hour. If the **Celery worker** or **Celery Beat** is not running, no new signals will be created.

**On the production server, run:**

```bash
ps aux | grep -E 'celery|beat' | grep -v grep
```

**What to do:**  
- Take a **screenshot** (or copy-paste) of the **full output** and share it.  
- If the output is **empty** (no lines), that means Celery worker and/or Beat are **not running** — that is the most likely cause.

*After you run Step 1 and share the result, you will get Step 2.*
